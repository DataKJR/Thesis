	abstract = {CONTEXT: The health of the skeletal system is important for athletes young and old. From the early benefits of exercise on bones to the importance of osteoporosis prevention and treatment, bone health affects the ability to be active throughout life.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed articles dating from 1986 to 2016 were used for the review. Relevant terms such as keywords and section titles of the article were searched and articles identified were reviewed for relevance to this article.
STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Levels 1 through 4 evidence included.
RESULTS: There is strong evidence that exercise benefits bone health at every age and is a critical factor in osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Vitamin D, calcium, and hormones play vital roles in ensuring optimal bone health. When there is an imbalance between exercise and nutrition, as seen in the female athlete triad, bone health is compromised and can lead to bone stress injuries and early osteoporosis. Both of these can lead to morbidity and lost time from training and competition. Thus, early recognition and appropriate treatment of the female athlete triad and other stress fracture risk factors are vital to preventing long-term bone health problems.
CONCLUSION: To optimize bone health, adequate nutrition, appropriate weightbearing exercise, strength training, and adequate calcium and vitamin D are necessary throughout life.},

	abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency has been commonly reported in elite athletes, but the vitamin D status of UK university athletes in different training environments remains unknown. The present study aimed to determine any seasonal changes in vitamin D status among indoor and outdoor athletes, and whether there was any relationship between vitamin D status and indices of physical performance and bone health. A group of forty-seven university athletes (indoor n 22, outdoor n 25) were tested during autumn and spring for serum vitamin D status, bone health and physical performance parameters. Blood samples were analysed for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25(OH)D) status. Peak isometric knee extensor torque using an isokinetic dynamometer and jump height was assessed using an Optojump. Aerobic capacity was estimated using the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans measured radial bone mineral density. Statistical analyses were performed using appropriate parametric/non-parametric testing depending on the normality of the data. s-25(OH)D significantly fell between autumn (52·8 (sd 22·0) nmol/l) and spring (31·0 (sd 16·5) nmol/l; P {\textless} 0·001). In spring, 34 \% of participants were considered to be vitamin D deficient ({\textless}25 nmol/l) according to the revised 2016 UK guidelines. These data suggest that UK university athletes are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Thus, further research is warranted to investigate the concomitant effects of low vitamin D status on health and performance outcomes in university athletes residing at northern latitudes.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in general interest in and research into vitamin D, with many athletes now taking vitamin D supplements as part of their everyday dietary regimen. The most recognized role of vitamin D is its regulation of calcium homeostasis; there is a strong relationship between vitamin D and bone health in non-athletic individuals. In contrast, data have consistently failed to demonstrate any relationship between serum 25[OH]D and bone health, which may in part be due to the osteogenic stimulus of exercise. Vitamin D may interact with extra-skeletal tissues such as muscle and the immune system to modulate recovery from damaging exercise and infection risk. Given that many athletes now engage in supplementation, often consuming extreme doses of vitamin D, it is important to assess whether excessive vitamin D can be detrimental to health. It has been argued that toxic effects only occur when serum 25[OH]D concentrations are greater than 180 nmol·l−1, but data from our laboratory have suggested high-dose supplementation could be problematic. Finally, there is a paradoxical relationship between serum 25[OH]D concentration, ethnicity, and markers of bone health: Black athletes often present with low serum 25[OH]D without physiological consequences. One explanation for this could be genetic differences in vitamin D binding protein due to ethnicity, resulting in greater concentrations of bioavailable (or free) vitamin D in some ethnic groups. In the absence of any pathology, screening may be unnecessary and could result in incorrect supplementation. Data must now be re-examined, taking into consideration bioavailable or “free” vitamin D in ethnically diverse groups to enable new thresholds and target concentrations to be established; perhaps, for now, it is time to “set vitamin D free”.},

	abstract = {Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs) was first introduced in 2014 by the International Olympic Committee’s expert writing panel, identifying a syndrome of deleterious health and performance outcomes experienced by female and male athletes exposed to low energy availability (LEA; inadequate energy intake in relation to exercise energy expenditure). Since the 2018 REDs consensus, there have been {\textgreater}170 original research publications advancing the field of REDs science, including emerging data demonstrating the growing role of low carbohydrate availability, further evidence of the interplay between mental health and REDs and more data elucidating the impact of LEA in males. Our knowledge of REDs signs and symptoms has resulted in updated Health and Performance Conceptual Models and the development of a novel Physiological Model. This Physiological Model is designed to demonstrate the complexity of either problematic or adaptable LEA exposure, coupled with individual moderating factors, leading to changes in health and performance outcomes. Guidelines for safe and effective body composition assessment to help prevent REDs are also outlined. A new REDs Clinical Assessment Tool-­Version 2 is introduced to facilitate the detection and clinical diagnosis of REDs based on accumulated severity and risk stratification, with associated training and competition recommendations. Prevention and treatment principles of REDs are presented to encourage best practices for sports organisations and clinicians. Finally, methodological best practices for REDs research are outlined to stimulate future high-­quality research to address important knowledge gaps.},

	abstract = {Background: Identifying the risk factors associated with a bone stress injury (BSI), including stress reactions and stress fractures, may aid in targeting those at increased risk and in formulating prevention guidelines for exercising girls and women.
Purpose: To evaluate the effect of single or combined risk factors as defined by the female athlete triad—a syndrome involving 3 interrelated spectrums consisting of energy availability, menstrual function, and bone mass—with the incidence of BSIs in a multicenter prospective sample of 4 cohorts of physically active girls and women.
Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
Methods: At baseline, participants’ (N = 259; mean age, 18.1 ± 0.3 years) anthropometric characteristics, eating attitudes and behaviors, menstrual function, sports participation or exercise activity, and pathological weight control behaviors were assessed. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured the bone mass of the whole body, total hip, femoral neck, lumbar spine, and body composition. Participants were followed prospectively for the occurrence of injuries; those injuries confirmed by a physician were recorded.
Results: Twenty-eight participants (10.8\%) incurred a BSI. Forty-six percent of those who had ≥12 h/wk of purposeful exercise, a bone mineral density (BMD) Z score {\textless}–1.0, and who exhibited 3 to 4 of the following: BMI {\textless}21.0 kg/m2, oligo- or amenorrhea, elevated dietary restraint, and/or participation in a leanness sport exercise/activity at baseline, incurred a BSI during the prospective study period. Single factors significantly (P {\textless} .05) associated with the development of a BSI included ≥12 h/wk of purposeful exercise (14.7\%), BMI {\textless}21.0 kg/m2 (15.3\%), and low bone mass (BMD Z score {\textless}–1.0; 21.0\%). The strongest 2- and 3-variable combined risk factors were low BMD (Z score {\textless}–1.0) + ≥12 h/wk of exercise, with 29.7\% incurring a BSI (odds ratio [OR], 5.1; 95\% CI, 2.2-12.1), and ≥12 h/wk of exercise + leanness sport/activity + dietary restraint, with 46.2\% incurring a BSI (OR, 8.7; 95\% CI, 2.7-28.3).
Conclusion: In the sample, which included female adolescents and young adults participating in competitive or recreational exercise activities, the risk of BSIs increased from approximately 15\% to 20\% for significant single risk factors to 30\% to 50\% for significant combined female athlete triad–related risk factor variables. These data support the notion that the cumulative risk for BSIs increases as the number of Triad-related risk factors accumulates.},

However, it is unclear how well women have been considered in the research underpinning current supplementation practices. We conducted an audit of the literature supporting the use of calcium, iron, and vitamin D. Of the 299 studies, including 25,171 participants, the majority (71\%) of participants were women. Studies with exclusively female cohorts (37\%) were also more prevalent than those examining males in isolation (31\%). However, study designs considering divergent responses between sexes were sparse, accounting for 7\% of the literature. Moreover, despite the abundance of female participants, the quality and quantity of the literature specific to female athletes was poor. Just 32\% of studies including women defined menstrual status, while none implemented best-practice methodologies regarding ovarian hormonal control. Additionally, only 10\% of studies included highly trained female athletes. Investigations of calcium supplementation were particularly lacking, with just two studies conducted in highly trained women. New research should focus on high-quality investigations specific to female athletes, alongside evaluating sex-based differences in the response to calcium, iron, and vitamin D, thus ensuring the specific needs of women have been considered in current protocols involving medical supplements.},

	abstract = {Physical activity is one of the major non-pharmacological methods for increasing and maintaining bone mineral density (BMD) and geometry. As such, it has an important role in maintaining peak bone mass and strength, thus reducing the risk of future osteoporotic fracture. However, not all exercise is effective, so a prescription in terms of optimal type, intensity, frequency and duration is required. Studies using animal models suggest that loading that is high in magnitude, rapidly applied and novel is most effective, whilst duration is less important beyond a threshold number of cycles. In human subjects cross-sectional studies comparing different athletic populations suggest that those who participate in high- or odd-impact sports have higher BMD; whilst impact exercise, strength training and brief high-impact-jump training interventions increase BMD in premenopausal women. In order to further elucidate exercise recommendations to optimise bone health in this population, the usefulness of brief high-impact unilateral exercises has been evaluated. Brief hopping exercises were shown to be feasible for sedentary premenopausal women, producing ground-reaction forces as high as those from jumping. Regularly performing these hopping exercises over 6 months was found to increase femoral-neck BMD of the trained leg relative to the control leg. Unilateral high-impact exercise may therefore improve bone strength of the trained limb and provide a useful model for comparing exercise prescriptions to help define the most efficient and effective exercise recommendations for the bone health of premenopausal women.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of current vitamin D status (measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D) with respiratory infections and lung function. We used cross-sectional data from 6789 participants in the nationwide 1958 British birth cohort who had measurements of 25(OH)D, lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)) and respiratory infections available from the age of 45 years. In this population, the prevalence of respiratory infections had a strong seasonal pattern in the opposite direction to the pattern for 25(OH)D concentrations. Each 10 nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 7 \% lower risk of infection (95 \% CI 3, 11 \%) after adjustment for adiposity, lifestyle and socio-economic factors. For FEV1 and FVC, each 10 nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D was associated with 8 (95 \% CI 3, 13) ml and 13 (95 \% CI 7, 20) ml higher volume, respectively, after controlling for covariates. Associations of 25(OH)D with FEV1 and FVC were only slightly attenuated after further adjustment for infection and other respiratory illness. In conclusion, vitamin D status had a linear relationship with respiratory infections and lung function. Randomised controlled trials are warranted to investigate the role of vitamin D supplementation on respiratory health and to establish the underlying mechanisms.},

The universal occurrence of stress fracture and its possible at-risk nature for serious injury if undertreated underscores the need to observe good treatment principles. With these principles in mind, the physician can usually treat stress fracture without major interruption of the recreational or competitive athlete's sport style.},

	abstract = {With ageing, bone tissue undergoes significant compositional, architectural and metabolic alterations potentially leading to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is the most prevalent bone disorder, which is characterised by progressive bone weakening and an increased risk of fragility fractures. Although this metabolic disease is conventionally associated with ageing and menopause, the predisposing factors are thought to be established during childhood and adolescence. In light of this, exercise interventions implemented during maturation are likely to be highly beneficial as part of a long-term strategy to maximise peak bone mass and hence delay the onset of age- or menopause-related osteoporosis. This notion is supported by data on exercise interventions implemented during childhood and adolescence, which confirmed that weight-bearing activity, particularly if undertaken during peripubertal development, is capable of generating a significant osteogenic response leading to bone anabolism. Recent work on human ageing and epigenetics suggests that undertaking exercise after the fourth decade of life is still important, given the anti-ageing effect and health benefits provided, potentially occurring via a delay in telomere shortening and modification of DNA methylation patterns associated with ageing. Exercise is among the primary modifiable factors capable of influencing bone health by preserving bone mass and strength, preventing the death of bone cells and anti-ageing action provided.},

	abstract = {Exercise during growth may contribute to the prevention of osteoporosis by increasing peak bone mineral density (BMD). However, exercise during puberty may be associated with primary amenorrhea and low peak BMD, while exercise after puberty may be associated with secondary amenorrhea and bone loss. As growth before puberty is relatively sex hormone independent, are the prepubertal years the time during which exercise results in higher BMD? Are any benefits retained in adulthood? We measured areal BMD (g/cm2) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 45 active prepubertal female gymnasts aged 10.4 +/- 0.3 years (mean +/- SEM), 36 retired female gymnasts aged 25.0 +/- 0.9 years, and 50 controls. The results were expressed as a standardized deviation (SD) or Z score adjusted for bone age in prepubertal gymnasts and chronological age in retired gymnasts. In the cross-sectional analyses, areal BMD in the active prepubertal gymnasts was 0.7-1.9 SD higher at the weight-bearing sites than the predicted mean in controls (p {\textless} 0.01). The Z scores increased as the duration of training increased (r = 0.32-0.48, p ranging between {\textless}0.04 and {\textless}0.002). During 12 months, the increase in areal BMD (g/cm2/year) of the total body, spine, and legs in the active prepubertal gymnasts was 30-85\% greater than in prepubertal controls (all p {\textless} 0.05). In the retired gymnasts, the areal BMD was 0.5-1.5 SD higher than the predicted mean in controls at all sites, except the skull (p ranging between {\textless}0.06 and {\textless}0.0001). There was no diminution across the 20 years since retirement (mean 8 +/- 1 years), despite the lower frequency and intensity of exercise. The prepubertal years are likely to be an opportune time for exercise to increase bone density. As residual benefits are maintained into adulthood, exercise before puberty may reduce fracture risk after menopause.},

The purpose of this study was to examine longitudinal changes in bone mineral density (BMD), body composition, and dietary intake in gymnasts and controls. Nonathletic, college-age women (: n = 9) were selected as a control group for comparison to the gymnasts (n = 10). Initial BMDs for the gymnasts were determined by using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar, DPX) at the beginning of their final competitive year. Initial BMDs for the controls were measured during a similar time-frame. Follow-up measurements were made at least 1-year after the initial measurement. Gymnasts had significantly greater BMD of the femoral neck (1.262 versus 1.058 g/cm2, respectively), Ward's triangle (1.230 versus 1.008 g/cm2), greater trochanter (1002 versus 0.822 g/cm2), and total body (1.232 versus 1.145 g/cm2) than controls while still competing (P {\textless} .05). Following retirement from competition, (mean years of retirement, 4 years), BMD of the gymnasts remained significantly greater than controls at total body, femoral neck, trochanter, and Ward's triangle (P {\textless} .05). Significant declines in femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and greater trochanter BMD were found in both gymnasts and controls (0.72\% to 1.9\% per year), but only gymnasts had a significant decline at the lumbar spine (0.87\% per year). In conclusion, BMD changes in former gymnasts appear to be site-specific, and gymnasts continue to have greater proximal femur BMD than controls, despite their decreased exercise, which may help postpone or prevent osteoporosis later in life.},

	abstract = {Athletes should pay more attention to their bone health, whether this relates to their longer-term bone health (e.g. risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis) or their shorter-term risk of bony injuries. Perhaps the easiest way to do this would be to modify their training loads, although this advice rarely seems popular with coaches and athletes for obvious reasons. As such, other possibilities to support the athletes' bone health need to be explored. Given that bone is a nutritionally modified tissue and diet has a significant influence on bone health across the lifespan, diet and nutritional composition seem like obvious candidates for manipulation. The nutritional requirements to support the skeleton during growth and development and during ageing are unlikely to be notably different between athletes and the general population, although there are some considerations of specific relevance, including energy availability, low carbohydrate availability, protein intake, vitamin D intake and dermal calcium and sodium losses. Energy availability is important for optimising bone health in the athlete, although normative energy balance targets are highly unrealistic for many athletes. The level of energy availability beyond which there is no negative effect for the bone needs to be established. On the balance of the available evidence it would seem unlikely that higher animal protein intakes, in the amounts recommended to athletes, are harmful to bone health, particularly with adequate calcium intake. Dermal calcium losses might be an important consideration for endurance athletes, particularly during long training sessions or events. In these situations, some consideration should be given to pre-exercise calcium feeding. The avoidance of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is important for the athlete to protect their bone health. There remains a lack of information relating to the longer-term effects of different dietary and nutritional practices on bone health in athletes, something that needs to be addressed before specific guidance can be provided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite an increasing rate of women participating in professional sports, emergency services, and military settings where they are exposed to exertional heat stress, our understanding of female thermoregulation and the detrimental effects of heat on women's performance, especially regarding the menstrual cycle, is limited. This review aimed to quantify the representation of women in exercise thermoregulation research between 2010 and 2019 and the frequency that these articles reported details pertaining to female participants' menstrual cycle to determine the volume of novel research that is directly relevant to this growing population.
METHODS: Original exercise thermoregulatory studies published in three major sports medicine databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and SPORTDiscus) between 2010 and 2019 were surveyed. Articles were screened to determine the number of female and male participants in the study and whether studies involving women reported menstrual orientation or phase. Research involving healthy adult participants and an exercise protocol with a thermoregulatory outcome measure were included in the review.
RESULTS: A total of 1407 articles were included in the review, involving 28,030 participants. The annual representation of women ranged from a mean of 11.6\% [95\% credible interval (CI); 9.2, 14.3] to 17.8\% [95\% CI; 15.2, 20.6] across the 10 years, indicating studies predominantly included men. Nonetheless, there was a small statistical increase in the overall proportion of women, with a mean overall proportion change of 0.7\% [95\% CI; 0.2, 1.2] per year. The increase appeared to be driven by a reduction in the number of studies including only men, rather than studies including more women alongside men, or increased women-only studies. Less than one third of articles involving women reported the menstrual orientation of participants and less than one quarter reported both menstrual orientation and phase. This study shows that women were proportionally underrepresented in exercise thermoregulation research during the past decade and the majority of studies did not report menstrual cycle details of female participants. Researchers should consider including women in future work where their inclusion could contribute meaningful data that enhance the evidence-based and ultimately improves our comprehension of women's thermal physiology.},

	abstract = {Until recently, there has been less demand for and interest in female-specific sport and exercise science data. As a result, the vast majority of high-quality sport and exercise science data have been derived from studies with men as participants, which reduces the application of these data due to the known physiological differences between the sexes, specifically with regard to reproductive endocrinology. Furthermore, a shortage of specialist knowledge on female physiology in the sport science community, coupled with a reluctance to effectively adapt experimental designs to incorporate female-specific considerations, such as the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptive use, pregnancy and the menopause, has slowed the pursuit of knowledge in this field of research. In addition, a lack of agreement on the terminology and methodological approaches (i.e., gold-standard techniques) used within this research area has further hindered the ability of researchers to adequately develop evidenced-based guidelines for female exercisers. The purpose of this paper was to highlight the specific considerations needed when employing women (i.e., from athletes to non-athletes) as participants in sport and exercise science-based research. These considerations relate to participant selection criteria and adaptations for experimental design and address the diversity and complexities associated with female reproductive endocrinology across the lifespan. This statement intends to promote an increase in the inclusion of women as participants in studies related to sport and exercise science and an enhanced execution of these studies resulting in more high-quality female-specific data.},

Although research has found that athletes generally do not meet the U.S. dietary reference intake for vitamin D, inadequate endogenous synthesis is the most probable reason for insufficient/deficient status. Given the recent findings, it is imperative that sports dietitians and physicians routinely assess vitamin D status and make recommendations to help athletes achieve a serum 25(OH)D concentration of {\textgreater}or=32 and preferably {\textgreater}or=40 ng.mL(-1).

Vitamin D has also been associated with chronic health problems such as bowel and colonic cancer, arthritis, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In recent decades, there has been increased awareness of the impact of vitamin D on muscle morphology and function, but this is not well recognized in the Sports Medicine literature. In the early 20th century, athletes and coaches felt that ultraviolet rays had a positive impact on athletic performance, and increasingly, evidence is accumulating to support this view. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies allude to a functional role for vitamin D in muscle and more recently the discovery of the vitamin D receptor in muscle tissue provides a mechanistic understanding of the function of vitamin D within muscle. The identification of broad genomic and non-genomic roles for vitamin D within skeletal muscle has highlighted the potential impact vitamin D deficiency may have on both under-performance and the risk of injury in athletes.

Serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone and bone turnover markers osteocalcin (OC) and beta carboxy-terminal collagen cross-links (β-Ctx), as well as body composition and muscle performance were examined. Hormones were tested using routine laboratory methods. Fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral density in whole body, as well as femur and lumbar spine were evaluated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle performance was assessed through isokinetic knee extension and flexion, countermovement jump, and sprint running. 25(OH)D was low (50.5 ± 12.8 nmol l⁻¹), whereas the values of bone turnover markers were markedly high (OC: 59.4 ± 18.6 µg l⁻¹; β-Ctx: 1075 ± 408 ng l⁻¹). All bone and muscle measurements were normal or above normal. 25(OH)D was not significantly correlated with most of the parameters of bone and muscle quality or function, except the knee extension time to peak torque (r = −0.50, p = .03). In conclusion, the level of vitamin D is markedly low in adolescent female soccer players during the winter in Sweden. However, vitamin D levels did not significantly correlate with measures of bone and muscle except a moderate correlation in time to peak torque in the knee extensors. The practical implication of low vitamin D levels in young growing female athletes remains unclear.},

	abstract = {Objective
 Nutritional status is important for health and competitive achievement. This area remains understudied among elite-level female athletes and is appropriate for research. We examined nutritional status and cardiovascular health markers of two groups of female athletes of the same age and competition period, involved in weight-bearing and a non-weight-bearing sport: gymnasts (n = 17) and swimmers (n = 14); mean age 17.4 and 16.6 years. 

Methods
 Body composition and dietary intake were assessed by bioelectrical impedance and Food Frequency Questionnaire. The concentrations of serum micronutrients (B12, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and iron), blood lipids, and blood pressure (BP) were measured. Setting and Participants. A cross-sectional study of 31 athletes from Slovenia. 

Results
 Gymnasts had higher body mass index (21.5 vs. 20.1 kg/m2, p=0.043) and lower fat free mass (42.4 vs. 46.6 kg, p=0.024) than swimmers and comparable body fat percentage (22.5 vs. 22.8\%). Both groups had low intake of carbohydrates, fibre, polyunsaturated fats, protein (only gymnasts), and micronutrients (11/13 micronutrients gymnasts and 4/13 swimmers) and high intake of free sugars and saturated fats. Both groups also had significantly lower-than-recommended serum levels of 25 (OH) D. All cardiovascular risk factors were within recommended ranges. Gymnasts had higher LDL cholesterol (2.7 vs. 2.2 mmol/L, p {\textless} 0.011), and swimmers had higher systolic BP (126 vs. 107 mmHg, p {\textless} 0.001). 

Conclusions
 Dietary intake especially in gymnasts was suboptimal, which may reflect in anthropometric and cardiovascular marker differences between gymnasts and swimmers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is common in the general public and athletic populations and may impair skeletal muscle function. We therefore assessed the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on serum 25[OH]D concentrations and physical performance.
METHODS: 30 club-level athletes were block randomised (using baseline 25[OH]D concentrations) into one of three groups receiving either a placebo (PLB), 20 000 or 40 000 IU/week oral vitamin D3 for 12 weeks. Serum 25[OH]D and muscle function (1-RM bench press and leg press and vertical jump height) were measured presupplementation, 6 and 12 weeks postsupplementation. Vitamin D deficiency was defined in accordance with the US Institute of Medicine guideline ({\textless}50 nmol/l).
RESULTS: 57\% of the subject population were vitamin D deficient at baseline (mean±SD value 51±24 nmol/l). Following 6 and 12 weeks supplementation with 20 000 IU (79±14 and 85±10 nmol/l, respectively) or 40 000 IU vitamin D3 (98±14 and 91±24 nmol/l, respectively), serum vitamin D concentrations increased in all participants, with every individual achieving concentrations greater than 50 nmol/l. In contrast, vitamin D concentration in the PLB group decreased at 6 and 12 weeks (37±18 and 41±22 nmol/l, respectively). Increasing serum 25[OH]D had no significant effect on any physical performance parameter (p{\textgreater}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Both 20 000 and 40 000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation over a 6-week period elevates serum 25[OH]D concentrations above 50 nmol/l, but neither dose given for 12 weeks improved our chosen measures of physical performance.},

	abstract = {Background
Currently there are no data examining the relationship between the serum concentration of vitamin D bio-chemical marker 25(OH)D and strength and speed characteristics in elite young track and field athletes. Moreover, there are currently no data examining the correlation of vitamin D status with testosterone concentration in elite young track and field athletes. In studies involving members of the general population and athletes from other sports, conflicting data have been reported.

Material and methods
Athletes (n = 68) from both genders took part in this study. Male athletes (n = 23) with mean ± SD age of 18.2 ± 1.9 years and female athletes (n = 45) with mean ± SD age of 17.3 ± 2.6 years participated. All athletes were ranked in the Top-3 in their respective age group and their corresponding results were listed in the Top-20 European records according to https://www.tilastopaja.eu/ in 2021.

Results
The average 25(OH)D concentration was 36.5 ± 10.8 ng/mL and 37.8 ± 14.5 ng/mL in male and female athletes respectively. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (below 20 ng/ml) in both genders was only 5.8\%. In the whole group, only 27.9\% of athletes had 25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and 30 ng/ml, while 66.2\% of athletes had concentrations above 30 ng/ml. There was no difference in vitamin D status between male and female athletes. There was no statistically significant Kruskal-Wallace test correlation between 25(OH)D concentration and performance in the 20 m and 30 m sprint, counter-movement jump and broad jump. There was no correlation between serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and total testosterone in either male or female athletes.

Conclusion
In elite young track and field athletes who permanently live and train in an area above 50° north latitude, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the summer months was much lower than in previously published studies examining an athletic population, that may be related to the training process. In this specific group of athletes, no correlation was found between serum 25 (OH) D concentration and strength and speed characteristics or total testosterone concentration.},

J Strength Cond Res 30(9): 2648–2655, 2016—There is growing body of evidence implying that vitamin D may be associated with athletic performance, however, studies examining the effects of vitamin D on athletic performance are inconsistent. Moreover, very little literature exists about the vitamin D and training efficiency or adaptation, especially in high-level, well-trained athletes. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on training adaptation in well-trained football players. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: the placebo group (PG) and the experimental group (SG, supplemented with vitamin D, 5,000 IU per day). Both groups were subjected to High Intensity Interval Training Program. The selection to the groups was based on peak power results attained before the experiment and position on the field. Blood samples for vitamin D level were taken from the players. In addition, total work, 5, 10, 20, and 30 m running speed, squat jump, and countermovement jump height were determined. There were no significant differences between SG and PG groups for any power-related characteristics at baseline. All power-related variables, except the 30 m sprint running time, improved significantly in response to interval training. However, the mean change scores (the differences between posttraining and pretraining values) did not differ significantly between SG and PG groups. In conclusion, an 8-week vitamin D supplementation in highly trained football players was not beneficial in terms of response to High Intensity Interval Training. Given the current level of evidence, the recommendation to use vitamin D supplements in all athletes to improve performance or training gains would be premature. To avoid a seasonal decrease in 25(OH)D level or to obtain optimal vitamin D levels, the combination of higher dietary intake and vitamin D supplementation may be necessary.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of fall season vitamin D 3 supplementation on strength/power, body composition, and anabolic hormones in swimmers with optimal vitamin D status at summer’s end. Male and female National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I swimmers ( N = 19) with optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] randomly received 5,000 IU of vitamin D 3 (VITD) or placebo (PLA) daily for 12 weeks while participating in swimming and strength and conditioning training (August–November). Before and after the intervention, the participants underwent blood sampling for analysis of serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and strength/power testing (bench press, squat, dead lift, standing broad jump, vertical jump, and dips and pull-ups). Sex was used as a covariate for analyses. The 25(OH)D was decreased by 44\% in PLA ( p {\textless} .05) and increased by 8\% in VITD over the 12 weeks. Fat-free mass increased in VITD (56.4–59.1 kg; p {\textless} .05), but not PLA (59.4–59.7 kg; p {\textless} .01). Significant Group × Time interaction effects were observed for dead lift ( F = 21.577, p {\textless} .01) and vertical jump ( F = 11.219, p {\textless} .01), but no other strength/power tests. Total testosterone decreased similarly in both groups, but free testosterone decreased and sex hormone-binding globulin increased only in PLA ( p {\textless} .01). There were no group differences or changes in insulin-like growth factor 1 with the intervention. The findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation is an efficacious strategy to maintain 25(OH)D during the fall season training and to enhance some aspects of strength/power and fat-free mass in swimmers. Further research on the relationship between vitamin D and anabolic hormones is needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Indoor athletes have been shown to be prone to vitamin D3 deficiency. The aim of the study was to examine the acute effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle function using isokinetic dynamometry.
DESIGN: Randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
SETTING: Institutional.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult male white national level judoka athletes (n = 22) who were involved in full-time training. Exclusion criteria were vitamin supplementation, overseas travel to sunny climes, and/or an injury incurred during the last 3 months before testing.
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly allocated to the treatment (150 000IU vitamin D3) or placebo and given blinded supplements by an independent researcher. Participants were tested twice, 8 days apart, on a Monday morning before the start of judo training and after 2 days of rest. A 5 to 7 mL of blood sample was collected followed by isokinetic concentric quadriceps and hamstring muscle function assessments on the right leg at 30 and 200°·s.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze isokinetic muscle force and serum 25(OH)D3. Regression to the mean was used to examine changes in 25(OH)D3 levels over the study period.
RESULTS: The treatment group demonstrated a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D levels (34\%, P ≤ 0.001) and muscle strength (13\%, P = 0.01) between days 1 and 8. No significant differences were found for the placebo group for the same period.
CONCLUSIONS: A single bolus of 150 000IU vitamin D3 had a significant positive effect on serum 25(OH)D levels and muscle function in vitamin D insufficient elite indoor athletes.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Serum 25(OH)D3 levels of indoor athletes should be monitored throughout the year and especially during winter months. Beneficial responses, in muscle strength and serum 25(OH)D3, to 1 dose of vitamin D3 supplementation can be observed within 1 week of ingestion. Muscle strength is linked to serum 25(OH)D levels.},

Methods: A total of 84 participants volunteered; exclusion criteria and dropout (19\%) reduced the cohort to 67 participants (females = 29 and males = 38; 17–19 y). Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention or placebo group (2∶1 ratio). All provided a venous blood sample before and after the 4-mo study period. The intervention group received 120,000 IU vitamin D to be taken over a 1-wk period, and the placebo group received the same number of inert pills. Participants completed a series of muscle function tests before and after the monitoring period. Injury incidence was recorded by the independent health team at the school. Results: Preintervention, 6\% of the cohort were vitamin D deficient, 81\% were insufficient, and 13\% had sufficient levels; postintervention, 53\% were insufficient and 47\% were sufficient.

	abstract = {Background:
There has been no report of the vitamin D status of the professional athletes from Iran to date. This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of weekly vitamin D supplementation on athletic performance in Iranian athletes expedited to Asian competition in Taipei, China, 2015.

Methods:
This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial. Seventy subjects were enrolled in the study. The athletes were randomly divided into two groups: vitamin D supplement (D; received 50,000 IU of vitamin D supplement weekly) and control (P, received a placebo weekly). Duration of the study was 8 weeks. Anthropometric, dietary, athletic performance, and biochemical evaluations were performed for all subjects in the beginning and in the end of the intervention period.

Results:
A significant rise in circulating 25(OH)D concentration was observed in D group (17.3 ± 16.9 ng/mL, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas in P group, there was a statistically significant decrement (−3.1 ± 8.4 ng/mL, P = 0.040). There were no either within- or between-group significant differences in Ergo jump, vertical jump, and agility tests. In strength leg press tests, both groups showed a significant improvement. However, comparisons of changes revealed that the improvement in D group was significantly higher than in P group (P = 0.034). Moreover, in sprint test (one repetition-Max, 1RM), only D group had a significant within-group improvement (P = 0.030).

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Vitamin D deficiency is very common in women of reproductive age. Studies in animals suggests a link between vitamin D and reproductive hormone biosynthesis. A systematic analysis of the correlation of reproductive hormones in reproductive-aged women with both total and free vitamin D was, however, not done so far. This cross-sectional study was performed in 351 healthy reproductive age Caucasian women (median age, 28.0 years; interquartile ranges, 24.7-31.0 years). We measured serum levels of both total and free 25(OH)D, endocrinological, hematological and biochemical parameters. Spearman’s rank correlations were performed to assess the correlation between 25(OH)D metabolites and selected parameters. Total vitamin D and free vitamin D measurements correlated well (rho=0.912, p \&lt; 0.0001). Both total 25(OH)D and free 25(OH)D showed significant negative correlation with FAI (rho=-0.229, p\&lt;0.0001 and rho=-0.195, p\&lt;0.0001 for total and free 25(OH)D, respectively); LH (rho=-0.177, p=0.001 and rho=-0.114, p=0.04 for total and free 25(OH)D, respectively), testosterone (rho=-0.174, p=0.001 and rho=-0.190, p\&lt;0.0001 for total and free 25(OH)D, respectively) and AMH (rho=-0.130, p=0.015 and rho=-0.107, p=0.047 for total and free 25(OH)D, respectively). Our study showed comparable correlations of both total and free 25(OH)D with endocrinological parameters, i.e. inverse correlations with free androgen index, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, LH/FSH ratio, androstenedione and anti-Müllerian hormone, and also with hematological and biochemical parameters, i.e. inverse correlations with erythrocytes, hsCRP and leukocytes count, and positive correlation with transferrin saturation, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume in healthy reproductive age women.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has been well-known for its function in maintaining calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and promoting bone mineralization. There is some evidence that in addition to sex steroid hormones, the classic regulators of human reproduction, vitamin D also modulates reproductive processes in women and men.
AIM: The aim of this review was to assess the studies that evaluated the relationship between vitamin D and fertility in women and men as well as in animals.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in Pubmed for relevant English language publications published until October 2011.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes are found in reproductive tissues of women and men. Vdr knockout mice have significant gonadal insufficiency, decreased sperm count and motility, and histological abnormalities of testis, ovary and uterus. Moreover, we present evidence that vitamin D is involved in female reproduction including IVF outcome (clinical pregnancy rates) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In PCOS women, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with obesity, metabolic, and endocrine disturbances and vitamin D supplementation might improve menstrual frequency and metabolic disturbances in those women. Moreover, vitamin D might influence steroidogenesis of sex hormones (estradiol and progesterone) in healthy women and high 25(OH)D levels might be associated with endometriosis. In men, vitamin D is positively associated with semen quality and androgen status. Moreover, vitamin D treatment might increase testosterone levels. Testiculopathic men show low CYP21R expression, low 25(OH)D levels, and osteoporosis despite normal testosterone levels.},

However, there are nuances in its interpretation as values of 25(OH)D do not correlate absolutely with the amount of 'bioavailable' vitamin to the cells. Vitamin D should be regarded as a hormone and influences between 5\% and 10\% of our total genome. Determining the precise effect of the vitamin, isolated from the actions of other cofactors, is not straightforward and restricts our complete understanding of all of its actions. Deficiency has harmful effects on not only bone and muscle but also wider areas, including immunity and respiratory and neurological activities. More caution should be applied regarding the ability of supranormal vitamin D levels to elevate athletic performance. Hopefully, future research will shed more light on optimal levels of vitamin D and supplementation regimes, and improved understanding of its intracellular control of our genetic mechanisms and how extrinsic influences modify its activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low vitamin D levels along with high-intensity athletic training may put an athlete at increased risk for a stress fracture.
PURPOSE: To assess whether supplementation with vitamin D is associated with a reduced risk of stress fractures in college athletes. We also assessed differences in vitamin D levels among athletes participating in outdoor versus indoor sports.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: The study participants included 802 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I intercollegiate athletes (497 men and 305 women) on a sports team for at least 1 semester from 2012 to 2018. All athletes who had a baseline vitamin D level in their medical record were included. Athletes with vitamin D levels {\textless}40 ng/mL were given vitamin D supplements. We assessed differences in the rate of stress fracture among those who maintained or improved vitamin D levels to ≥40 ng/mL and those who did not, as well as differences in average baseline vitamin D levels by sport type (indoor vs outdoor).
RESULTS: The rate of stress fracture was 12\% higher (95\% CI, 6-19; P {\textless} .001) for those who remained low in vitamin D compared with those who were low at baseline but improved their vitamin D status to ≥40 ng/mL. The rate of stress fracture was also 12\% higher (95\% CI, 5-18; P {\textless} .001) for those who had low vitamin D levels compared with those who maintained normal levels. The mean baseline vitamin D values were significantly higher for men participating in outdoor sports versus indoor sports. For men, the mean vitamin D level was 5.7 ng/mL higher (95\% CI, 0.9-10.5; P = .01) in outdoor athletes. For women, the mean vitamin D level was 3.7 ng/mL higher (95\% CI, -0.58 to 8.03; P {\textless} .04) for outdoor versus indoor sports.
CONCLUSION: Study results indicated that correcting low serum vitamin D levels reduces the risk of stress fracture. This study also presented evidence that athletes who participate in indoor sports may be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency than those who compete in outdoor sports.},

	abstract = {There are numerous risk factors for stress fractures that have been identified in literature. Among different risk factors, a prolonged lack of vitamin D (25(OH)D) can lead to stress fractures in athletes since 25(OH)D insufficiency is associated with an increased incidence of a fracture. A 25(OH)D value of {\textless}75.8 nmol/L is a risk factor for a stress fracture. 25(OH)D deficiency is, however, only one of several potential risk factors. Well-documented risk factors for a stress fracture include female sex, white ethnicity, older age, taller stature, lower aerobic fitness, prior physical inactivity, greater amounts of current physical training, thinner bones, 25(OH)D deficiency, iron deficiency, menstrual disturbances, and inadequate intake of 25(OH)D and/or calcium. Stress fractures are not uncommon in athletes and affect around 20\% of all competitors. Most athletes with a stress fracture are under 25 years of age. Stress fractures can affect every sporty person, from weekend athletes to top athletes. Stress fractures are common in certain sports disciplines such as basketball, baseball, athletics, rowing, soccer, aerobics, and classical ballet. The lower extremity is increasingly affected for stress fractures with the locations of the tibia, metatarsalia and pelvis. Regarding prevention and therapy, 25(OH)D seems to play an important role. Athletes should have an evaluation of 25(OH)D -dependent calcium homeostasis based on laboratory tests of 25-OH-D3, calcium, creatinine, and parathyroid hormone. In case of a deficiency of 25(OH)D, normal blood levels of ≥30 ng/mL may be restored by optimizing the athlete’s lifestyle and, if appropriate, an oral substitution of 25(OH)D. Very recent studies suggested that the prevalence of stress fractures decreased when athletes are supplemented daily with 800 IU 25(OH)D and 2000 mg calcium. Recommendations of daily 25(OH)D intake may go up to 2000 IU of 25(OH)D per day.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Stress fractures are repetitive use injuries in which recurrent strains lead to material fatigue and microarchitectural discontinuities. They account for up to 20\% of athletic injuries, more often in women and in the setting of track-and-field events. In women, menstrual disturbances, low body mass index, low energy intake, and sometimes low bone mass, may be contributing factors. There are no standard protocols for evaluation or management of stress fractures.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Available literature published in English was retrieved using the following terms: stress fractures; fractures; osteoporosis, athletes, premenopausal women, and athletic triad; through PubMed. Reviews, original reports, and case reports were all included.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Despite lack of consistency among the publications, a phenotype emerges, namely of individuals whose bone mineral density is reduced along with low intake of dietary calcium and low circulating levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Limited experience suggests that calcium and vitamin D supplementation might be helpful. Bisphosphonates or teriparatide may accelerate fracture healing in special circumstances.
CONCLUSIONS: Most individuals who experience a stress fracture are young and healthy and do not appear to have an underlying metabolic bone disease. On the other hand, the presence of low bone mass and hormonal disturbances in some afflicted individuals might identify a cohort who needs endocrinological attention. Prospective, well-designed studies of stress fractures are needed to elucidate further underlying pathophysiological elements that predispose such individuals. Guidelines for prevention and treatment may follow from such well-controlled studies.},

Regarding stress fractures, serum vitamin D levels below 30 ng/mL appeared to be associated with an increased risk of stress fractures, and the meta-analysis showed increased odds ratio for stress fracture with vitamin D insufficiency. Regarding musculoskeletal injuries only two studies found that low serum vitamin D levels were associated with musculoskeletal injuries. Low serum vitamin D levels are associated with an enhanced risk of stress fractures, while no conclusion can be made regarding musculoskeletal injuries.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Stress fractures (SFx) are one of the most common and debilitating overuse injuries seen in military recruits, and they are also problematic for nonmilitary athletic populations. The goal of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine whether a calcium and vitamin D intervention could reduce the incidence of SFx in female recruits during basic training.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 5201 female Navy recruit volunteers and randomized them to 2000 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D/d or placebo. SFx were ascertained when recruits reported to the Great Lakes clinic with symptoms. All SFx were confirmed with radiography or technetium scan according to the usual Navy protocol.
RESULTS: A total of 309 subjects were diagnosed with a SFx resulting in an incidence of 5.9\% per 8 wk. Using intention-to-treat analysis by including all enrolled subjects, we found that the calcium and vitamin D group had a 20\% lower incidence of SFx than the control group (5.3\% versus 6.6\%, respectively, p = 0.0026 for Fisher's exact test). The per protocol analysis, including only the 3700 recruits who completed the study, found a 21\% lower incidence of fractures in the supplemented versus the control group (6.8\% versus 8.6\%, respectively, p = 0.02 for Fisher's exact test).
CONCLUSIONS: Generalizing the findings to the population of 14,416 women who entered basic training at the Great Lakes during the 24 mo of recruitment, calcium and vitamin D supplementation for the entire cohort would have prevented approximately 187 persons from fracturing. Such a decrease in SFx would be associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and financial costs.},

Calcium and vitamin D have been clearly shown to improve bone density and prevent fractures at all ages. However, the literature is conflicting as to the role of these nutrients in young athletes ages 18 to 35 years, both for bone development and for the prevention of bone overuse injuries. Differences in findings may relate to study design. Although retrospective and cross-sectional studies have had mixed results, the authors of prospective studies have consistently demonstrated a relationship of increased calcium intake with an improvement in bone density and a decrease in fracture risk. A randomized trial in female military recruits demonstrated that calcium/vitamin D supplementation reduced the incidence of stress fractures. A prospective study in young female runners demonstrated reduced incidence of stress fractures and increased bone mineral density with increased dietary calcium intake. Findings from both studies suggest female athletes and military recruits who consumed greater than 1500 mg of calcium daily exhibited the largest reduction in stress fracture injuries. To date, no prospective studies have been conducted in male athletes or in adolescent athletes. In most studies, males and nonwhite participants were poorly represented. Evidence regarding the relationship of vitamin D intake with the prevention of fractures in athletes is also limited. More prospective studies are needed to evaluate the role of calcium and vitamin D intake in prevention of stress fracture injuries in both male and female adolescent athletes, particularly those participating in sports with greater incidences of stress fracture injury.},

	abstract = {Body size, body composition, and physiology are basically similar in boys and girls before puberty. The adolescent growth spurt and puberty mark the period in life when sex differentiation and development begin. Peak height velocity for girls ranges from 10.5 to 13 years and for boys, 12.5 to 15 years. Peak weight velocity and menarche occur approximately 6 months and 1 year, respectively, after the height peak. On average, women have a larger surface area-to-mass ratio; lower bone mass; and wider, shallower pelvis compared with men. The implication of these characteristics is that women may have an advantage in dry heat, are more at risk for osteoporosis, and may be predisposed to experiencing knee problems. Overall, adult women have more body fat, less lean muscle mass, a gynoidal fat distribution, a lower resting metabolic rate, lower red blood cell mass, and lower hemoglobin and hematocrit compared with adult men. The difference in muscle strength between trained women and men can be explained by muscle mass size and not to differences in muscle fiber type or muscle adaptation. The lower resting metabolic rate is not related to gender per se, but to the fact that muscle mass is more metabolically active compared with fat. The lower VO2max in female athletes is explained primarily by differences in body composition and oxygen transport system between the sexes. A major problem occurring among female athletes is the misuse of prescribing low body fat for appearance and performance. The outcome is an athlete who appears to be in a negative caloric balance, and who is deficient in key nutrients. The consequences could result in the following cascading problems: disordered eating, iron deficiency anemia, amenorrhea, premature osteoporosis, and injuries.},

	abstract = {The amount of bone gained during childhood and adolescence impacts greatly on lifetime skeletal health. The purpose of this review is to summarize current evidence of the effects of gymnastics activities on bone mineral accrual during growth and to describe possible factors that influence bone mineral gains. The PubMed and SportDiscus databases were searched, and a total of 24 articles met the selection criteria and were included in this review. Artistic and rhythmic gymnasts presented higher bone mineral density and content values compared to untrained controls, despite possible negative effects associated with hormonal levels, dietary restrictions and body fat. The results suggest that gymnasts had similar bone turnover values compared to untrained controls. High-intensity mechanical loading of gymnastics activity appears to increase bone development and counterbalance negative effects, such as later pubertal development, lower body fat mass and lower hormone levels. In conclusion, gymnasts present higher bone mineral values in comparison with untrained controls. The osteogenic effect of gymnastics athletic activity has a positive influence on bone mineral accrual and overcomes the possible negative influence of high athletic activity that may cause negative energy balance and low body fat mass which are associated with lower bone accrual.,

                Children and adolescent gymnasts present higher bone mineral density and content values compared to untrained controls, despite a variety of possible negative factors.
              
              
                Gymnastics activity with high-impact mechanical loading appears to be especially osteogenic to achieve maximum possible peak bone accrual during growth and maturation.
              
              
                Skeletal benefits of gymnastics activity in childhood are maintained for several years after retirement from gymnastics trainings in young adulthood.},

fat. Adipose tissue is now recognized as an important endocrine organ releasing
an abundance of bioactive adipokines including, but not limited to, leptin,
adiponectin and resistin. Obesity is a common comorbidity amongst pulmonary
arterial hypertension patients, with 30\% to 40\% reported as obese, independent
of other comorbidities associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (e.g.
obstructive sleep apnoea). An ‘obesity paradox’ has been observed, where obesity
has been associated with subclinical right ventricular dysfunction but
paradoxically may confer a protective effect on right ventricular function once
pulmonary hypertension develops. Obesity and pulmonary arterial hypertension
share multiple pathophysiological mechanisms including inflammation, oxidative
stress, elevated leptin (proinflammatory) and reduced adiponectin
(anti-inflammatory). The female prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension
has instigated the hypothesis that estrogens may play a causative role in its
development. Adipose tissue, a major site for storage and metabolism of sex
steroids, is the primary source of estrogens and circulating estrogens levels
which are elevated in postmenopausal women and men with pulmonary arterial
hypertension. This review discusses the functions of adipose tissue in both
health and obesity and the links between obesity and pulmonary arterial
hypertension. Shared pathophysiological mechanisms and the contribution of
specific fat depots, metabolic and sex-dependent differences are discussed.},

Although studies in sedentary populations have investigated the validity of DXA assessment of body composition, few studies have examined the issues of reliability in athletic populations and most studies which involve DXA measurements of body composition provide little information on their scanning protocols. This review presents a summary of the sources of error and variability in the measurement of body composition by DXA, and develops a theoretical model of best practice to standardize the conduct and analysis of a DXA scan. Components of this protocol include standardization of subject presentation (subjects rested, overnight-fasted and in minimal clothing) and positioning on the scanning bed (centrally aligned in a standard position using custom-made positioning aids) as well as manipulation of the automatic segmentation of regional areas of the scan results. Body composition assessment implemented with such protocol ensures a high level of precision, while still being practical in an athletic setting. This ensures that any small changes in body composition are confidently detected and correctly interpreted. The reporting requirements for studies involving DXA scans of body composition include details of the DXA machine and software, subject presentation and positioning protocols, and analysis protocols.},

	abstract = {The menstrual cycle, a fundamental biological process in women, extends its influence beyond reproduction, impacting sleep duration and cardiovascular health. This comprehensive review delves into the intricate connections that bind these three vital aspects of women's health. Beginning with thoroughly exploring the menstrual cycle, we uncover its phases and the dynamic hormonal fluctuations that underlie each stage. We pay special attention to estrogen and progesterone, the primary sex hormones orchestrating the menstrual cycle. With their rhythmic rise and fall, these hormones orchestrate events, affecting sleep duration, sleep patterns, and various indicators of cardiovascular well-being. The review examines how the menstrual cycle influences sleep patterns, exploring the nuanced changes in sleep duration observed throughout menstrual phases. We elucidate the contributing factors, encompassing hormonal fluctuations, the impact of pain and discomfort, and the significance of emotional and psychological factors. All of these elements collectively contribute to variations in sleep quality. Shifting our focus to the cardiovascular system, we investigate the bidirectional relationships between sleep disturbances and cardiovascular conditions, emphasizing the need to address sleep-related issues in the context of cardiovascular risk. The menstrual cycle is analyzed as a pivotal mediator in these intricate connections, exploring how hormonal fluctuations across menstrual phases can influence sleep patterns and cardiovascular health. This analysis provides valuable insights into the complex causality web. As clinical implications emerge, we emphasize the importance of tailoring healthcare strategies for individuals with irregular menstrual cycles. We explore potential interventions, from personalized care and hormone management to lifestyle adjustments, to improve sleep and cardiovascular well-being. In conclusion, this comprehensive review sheds light on the interplay between the menstrual cycle, sleep duration, and cardiovascular health. It underscores the urgent necessity for personalized healthcare approaches and preventive strategies, empowering women to navigate these intricate relationships. Ultimately, through a nuanced understanding of these interactions, we can work towards enhancing women's overall well-being and reducing cardiovascular risk within the context of menstrual cycle-related influences.},

Female sex has been suggested to have a favorable effect on glucose homeostasis, and the available evidence from hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp studies is summarized to delineate whether there is a gender difference in whole-body insulin sensitivity and in particular insulin-stimulated glucose uptake of skeletal muscle. Whether an eventual higher insulin sensitivity of female skeletal muscle can be related to gender-specific regulation of molecular metabolism will be topic for discussion. Gender differences in muscle fiber type distribution and substrate availability to and in skeletal muscle are highly relevant for substrate metabolism in men and women. In particular, the molecular machinery for glucose and fatty acid oxidative and storage capacities in skeletal muscle and its implications for substrate utilization during metabolic situations of daily living are discussed, emphasizing their relevance for substrate choice in the fed and fasted state, and during periods of physical activity and recovery. Together, handling of carbohydrate and lipids and regulation of their utilization in skeletal muscle have implications for whole-body glucose homeostasis in men and women. 17-β estradiol is the most important female sex hormone, and the identification of estradiol receptors in skeletal muscle has opened for a role in regulation of substrate metabolism. Also, higher levels of circulating adipokines as adiponectin and leptin in women and their implications for muscle metabolism will be considered.},

METHODS: This study involved 170 healthy 13-15-year-old girls divided into six groups based on activity: sport games (i.e. basketball, volleyball, badminton) (n=49), track sprint (n=24), rhythmic gymnastics (n=23), swimming (n=24), cross-country skiing (n=17) and sedentary controls (n=33). BMD and BMC at femoral neck and lumbar spine (L2-L4) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Visfatin, adiponectin, leptin, insulin and glucose were measured, and the insulin resistance index was calculated using homeostasis model assessment.
RESULTS: There were no relationships found between visfatin concentrations and bone mineral parameters in adolescent female athletes or controls. Adiponectin was inversely correlated to BMD and BMC of femoral neck and lumbar spine (r=-0.47-0.62) in the swimmer group only, but after adjustments for age, height and body mass these associations disappeared. Leptin concentrations correlated with bone mineral parameters even after adjusting for age, height and body mass (r=0.42-0.63) in the gymnast group only.
CONCLUSION: We may conclude that after adjustment, leptin is the only adipokine of those measured that correlates to femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD and femoral neck BMC in the rhythmic gymnast group.},

Insufficient EA due to increased exercise, reduced energy intake, or a combination of both, is a potent disruptor of the endocrine milieu. As such, EA is conceived as a key etiological factor underlying a plethora of physiological dysregulations described in the female athlete triad, its male counterpart and the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport models. Originally developed upon female-specific physiological responses, this concept has recently been extended to males, where experimental evidence is limited. The majority of data for all these models are from cross-sectional or observational studies where hypothesized chronic low energy availability (LEA) is linked to physiological maladaptation. However, the body of evidence determining causal effects of LEA on endocrine, and physiological function through prospective studies manipulating EA is comparatively small, with interventions typically lasting ≤ 5 days. Extending laboratory-based findings to the field requires recognition of the strengths and limitations of current knowledge.

	abstract = {To help refine nutritional guidelines for military servicewomen, we assessed bone turnover after manipulating the energy availability of 29 young women. Bone formation was impaired by less severe restrictions than that which increased bone resorption. Military servicewomen and others may need to improve their nutrition to avoid these effects.
INTRODUCTION: We determined the dose-response relationship between energy availability (defined as dietary energy intake minus exercise energy expenditure) and selected markers of bone turnover in 29 regularly menstruating, habitually sedentary, young women of normal body composition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 5 days in the early follicular phase of two menstrual cycles separated by at least 2 months, subjects expended 15 kcal/kgLBM/day in supervised exercise at 70\% of aerobic capacity and consumed controlled amounts of a clinical dietary product in balanced (45 kcal/kgLBM/day) and one of three restricted (either 10, 20, or 30 kcal/kgLBM/day) energy availability treatments in random order. Blood was sampled at 10-minute intervals, and urine was collected for 24 h. Samples were assayed for plasma osteocalcin (OC), serum type I procollagen carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP), and urinary N-telopeptide (NTX).
RESULTS: NTX concentrations (p {\textless} 0.01) and indices of bone resorption/formation uncoupling (Z(NTX-OC) and Z(NTX-PICP); both p {\textless} 10(-4)) were increased by the 10 kcal/kgLBM/day treatment. OC and PICP concentrations were suppressed by all restricted energy availability treatments (all p {\textless} 0.05). PICP declined linearly (p {\textless} 10(-6)) with energy availability, whereas most of the suppression of OC occurred abruptly between 20 and 30 kcal/kgLBM/day (p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These dose-response relationships closely resembled those of particular reproductive and metabolic hormones found in the same experiment and reported previously: similar relationships were observed for NTX and estradiol; for PICP and insulin; and for OC, triiodothyronine (T3), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. The uncoupling of bone resorption and formation by severely restricted energy availability, if left to continue, may lead to irreversible reductions in BMD, and the suppression of bone formation by less severe restrictions may prevent young women from achieving their genetic potential for peak bone mass. More prolonged experiments are needed to determine the dose-response relationships between chronic restrictions of energy availability and bone turnover.},

METHODS: By using a crossover design, ten eumenorrheic women (VO2 peak: 48.1 ± 3.3 ml·kg-1·min-1) completed all three, 3-day conditions in a randomised order: controlled EA (CON; 45 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1), low EA through dietary energy restriction (D-RES; 15 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1) and low EA through increasing exercise energy expenditure (E-RES; 15 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1), during the follicular phase of three menstrual cycles. In CON, D-RES and E-RES, participants consumed diets providing 45, 15 and 45 kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1. In E-RES only, participants completed supervised running sessions (129 ± 10 min·d-1) at 70\% of their VO2 peak that resulted in an exercise energy expenditure of 30 kcal·kg LBM-1·d-1. Blood samples were collected at baseline (BASE) and at the end of the 3-day period (D6) and analysed for bone turnover markers (β-CTX and P1NP), markers of calcium metabolism (PTH, albumin-adjusted Ca, Mg and PO4) and hormones (IGF-1, T3, insulin, leptin and 17β-oestradiol).
RESULTS: In D-RES, P1NP concentrations at D6 decreased by 17\% (BASE: 54.8 ± 12.7 μg·L-1, D6: 45.2 ± 9.3 μg·L-1, P {\textless} 0.001, d = 0.91) and were lower than D6 concentrations in CON (D6: 52.5 ± 11.9 μg·L-1, P = 0.001). P1NP did not change significantly in E-RES (BASE: 55.3 ± 14.4 μg·L-1, D6: 50.9 ± 15.8 μg·L-1, P = 0.14). β-CTX concentrations did not change following D-RES (BASE: 0.48 ± 0.18 μg·L-1, D6: 0.55 ± 0.17 μg·L-1) or E-RES (BASE: 0.47 ± 0.24 μg·L-1, D6: 0.49 ± 0.18 μg·L-1) (condition × time interaction effect, P = 0.17). There were no significant differences in P1NP (P = 0.25) or β-CTX (P = 0.13) responses between D-RES and E-RES. Both conditions resulted in reductions in IGF-1 (-13\% and - 23\% from BASE in D-RES and E-RES, both P {\textless} 0.01) and leptin (-59\% and - 61\% from BASE in D-RES and E-RES, both P {\textless} 0.001); T3 decreased in D-RES only (-15\% from BASE, P = 0.002) and PO4 concentrations decreased in E-RES only (-9\%, P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Low EA achieved through dietary energy restriction resulted in a significant decrease in bone formation but no change in bone resorption, whereas low EA achieved through exercise energy expenditure did not significantly influence bone metabolism. Both low EA conditions elicited significant and similar changes in hormone concentrations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The short-term effects of low energy availability (EA) on bone metabolism in physically active women and men are currently unknown.
PURPOSE: We evaluated the effects of low EA on bone turnover markers (BTMs) in a cohort of women and a cohort of men, and compared effects between sexes.
METHODS: These studies were performed using a randomised, counterbalanced, crossover design. Eleven eumenorrheic women and eleven men completed two 5-day protocols of controlled (CON; 45kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1) and restricted (RES; 15kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1) EAs. Participants ran daily on a treadmill at 70\% of their peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak) resulting in an exercise energy expenditure of 15kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1 and consumed diets providing 60 and 30kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1. Blood was analysed for BTMs [β-carboxyl-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX) and amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP)], markers of calcium metabolism [parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin-adjusted calcium (ACa), magnesium (Mg) and phosphate (PO4)] and regulatory hormones [sclerostin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), triiodothyronine (T3), insulin, leptin, glucagon-like-peptide-2 (GLP-2)].
RESULTS: In women, β-CTX AUC was significantly higher (P=0.03) and P1NP AUC was significantly lower (P=0.01) in RES compared to CON. In men, neither β-CTX (P=0.46) nor P1NP (P=0.12) AUCs were significantly different between CON and RES. There were no significant differences between sexes for any BTM AUCs (all P values{\textgreater}0.05). Insulin and leptin AUCs were significantly lower following RES in women only (for both P=0.01). There were no differences in any AUCs of regulatory hormones or markers of calcium metabolism between men and women following RES (all P values{\textgreater}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: When comparing within groups, five days of low EA (15kcal·kgLBM-1·d-1) decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption in women, but not in men, and no sex specific differences were detected.},

A clinical dietary product was used to set energy availability in four groups (10.8, 19.0, 25.0, 40.4 kcal.kg LBM-1.day-1). For 9 days beginning 3 days before treatments, blood was sampled once daily at 8 A.M.

Repeated-measures one-way analysis of variance followed by one-sided, two-sample post hoc Fischer's least significant difference tests of changes by treatment day 4 revealed that reductions in T3 (16\%, P {\textless} 0.00001) and fT3 (9\%, P {\textless} 0.01) occurred abruptly between 19.0 and 25.0 kcal.kg LBM-1.day-1 and that increases in fT4 (11\%, P {\textless} 0.05) and rT3 (22\%, P {\textless} 0.01) occurred abruptly between 10.8 and 19.0 kcal.kg LBM-1.day-1. Changes in T4 could not be distinguished. If energy deficiency suppresses reproductive as well as thyroid function, athletic amenorrhea might be prevented or reversed by increasing energy availability through dietary reform to 25 kcal.kg LBM-1.day-1, without moderating the exercise regimen.},

However, studies regarding resting energy expenditure (REE) in Japanese female athletes with menstrual disorders are lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether REE was suppressed in female Japanese athletes with menstrual disorders. In total, 22 highly trained intercollegiate athletes participated in this study; and body composition, REE, thyroid and reproductive hormone levels, and nutritional intake levels were measured. Predicted REE (REEp) was calculated using two different equations based on fat-free mass (FFM) and organ-tissue mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Individuals with menstrual disorders (MD group) had significantly lower height, body weight, and fat mass than those in the eumenorrheic (EU) group; however, the FFM did not differ between the groups. Both the measured REE (REEm) and REEm adjusted for FFM in the MD group were lower than those in the EU group. The REEm to REEp ratio, which indicates energy deficiency, was also lower in the MD group. In addition, although the MD group had lower triiodothyronine and progesterone levels, they were still within the normal range. Japanese female athletes with menstrual disorders may have lower REE than eumenorrheic athletes, even if thyroid and reproductive hormones are within the normal range.},

Adolescence and young adulthood are a critical period in the life of women for optimizing long-term bone health. Young athletes lead a demanding lifestyle with increased dietary requirements to meet the robust demands of energy expenditure to maintain a state of energy balance. During a time of fast paced changes and unpredictable societal demands on young athletes, it is important to review the severe consequences of energy deficiency and options for adequate management.

Recent findings
This review focuses on hormonal adaptations that occur in energy deficient female athletes that lead to menstrual irregularities and impaired bone health, increasing the risk for stress and other fractures. We also describe management strategies to mitigate the consequences of limited energy availability on bone and other outcomes.

Summary
These strategies should help guide the management of young female athletes to prevent irreversible changes to their bone health. Identifying current knowledge should help increase awareness among medical providers, which can then be communicated to the sports community, parents, and athletes.},

In all conditions, participants expended 15 kcal·kg FFM-1·day-1 during supervised cycling sessions. Serum samples were analyzed for markers of bone turnover, IGF-1 and leptin. The decrease in leptin during LEA-LP (-65.6 ± 4.3\%) and LEA-HP (-54.3 ± 16.7\%) was greater than during CON (-25.4 ± 11.4\%; p = 0.02). Decreases in P1NP (p = 0.04) and increases in CTX-I (p = 0.04) were greater in LEA than in CON, suggesting that LEA shifted bone turnover in favour of bone resorption. No differences were found between LEA-LP and LEA-HP. Thus, five days of LEA disrupted bone turnover, but these changes were not attenuated by a high-protein diet.},

Thus, we assessed the role of the candidate hormones, leptin, insulin, and estrogen in mediating fat mass effects on the skeleton. Specifically, we related these hormones and fat mass to BMD at the total hip, mid-lateral spine, and mid-distal radius in a sample of 137 premenopausal women (age range 21-54 years), 165 postmenopausal women (34-93 years), and 343 men (23-90 years) recruited from the general population. Fat mass and BMD were significantly related in pre- and postmenopausal women at multiple sites, whereas this relationship was only weakly present in men at the total hip. Serum leptin levels were also significantly related to BMD in the women, but not in the men. Insulin was associated with hip BMD in the women, and bioavailable estradiol (E2) was correlated with BMD at all sites in men and in postmenopausal women. In the women, adjusting for leptin reduced the strength of the association between fat mass and BMD, with further adjustments for insulin or bioavailable E2 having no additional effects. Adjusting for leptin in the men had no consistent effect on the relationship between fat mass and BMD. Collectively, these data suggest that there is a sexual dimorphism in the relationship of fat mass and leptin to BMD, with both being positively associated with BMD in women but not in men. In women, leptin may also mediate at least part of the protective effect of fat mass on the skeleton.},

Fat mass was not altered after training in either group. In contrast, both aerobic capacity (+13\% males, +9.1\% females) and insulin sensitivity (+35\% males, +82\% females) were significantly improved subsequent to training.

Because there are marked gender differences in circulating leptin, both men and women were studied. The body mass index (BMI), percent body fat (\% body fat), and serum leptin, insulin, cortisol, glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate,(BOHB), and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) were determined in 11 men and 13 women (age, 20 to 41 years; BMI, 21.2 to 26.8 kg/m2) before and during 7 days of energy restriction (-68\% +/- 1\% of daily energy requirements). Weight loss averaged about 4\% in both men and women. Leptin in men was 3.7 +/- 0.5 and decreased to 2.1 +/- 0.4 ng/mL (percent change [\%delta], -36\% +/- 6.0\%, P {\textless} .0005) during restriction. Concurrently, insulin decreased from 7.2 +/- 0.6 to 1.8 +/- 0.3 microU/mL (\%delta, -74\% +/- 4\%, P {\textless} .0001). In contrast, leptin was higher in women before (16.2 +/- 1.9 ng/mL) and after (6.0 +/- 0.8 ng/mL) restriction and decreased more than in men (\%delta, -61\% +/- 4\%, P {\textless} .02 v men), whereas the decrease of insulin in women was less than in men: 10.1 +/- 1.9 to 6.1 +/- 1.0 microU/mL (\%delta, -31\% +/- 9\%, P {\textless} .0025; P {\textless} .0005 v men), perhaps because glucose decreased less in women than in men. Overall, the changes of leptin during fasting were independently correlated with the changes of glucose (r = .53, P {\textless} .007), NEFA (r = .53, P {\textless} .01), and BOHB (r = .65, P {\textless} .001). In addition, the change of leptin correlated with a combined index of the parameters that reflect decreased glucose availability and increased lipolysis ([deltaglucose + deltainsulin + deltaNEFA]/3, r = .73, P {\textless} .0001) or a combined index of parameters that would be expected to limit glucose uptake by adipocytes ([deltaglucose + deltainsulin + deltacortisol]/3, r = .48, P {\textless} .02). We conclude that there are significant differences between men and women in the responses of leptin and insulin to energy restriction. Furthermore, decreases of circulating leptin during negative energy balance are related to changes of endocrine and metabolic parameters, suggesting that leptin secretion may be regulated by alterations of adipocyte glucose and lipid metabolism, ie, decreased glucose uptake and metabolism and increased lipolysis.},

	abstract = {Strenuously exercising young women with hypothalamic amenorrhea are hypoleptinemic and have low bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC), which predispose them to increased fracture risk. Short-term leptin replacement in these women corrects many neuroendocrine abnormalities and increases circulating levels of bone formation markers. Whether treatment with recombinant methionyl human leptin (metreleptin) for a long period improves BMD and BMC remains unknown. We studied 20 strenuously exercising young women with hypoleptinemia (leptin concentration {\textless}5 ng/mL) and hypothalamic amenorrhea of at least 6 months' duration. Eleven were randomized to metreleptin (initial dose, 0.08 mg/[kg·d] for 3 months; altered thereafter to 0.12 mg/kg for lack of efficacy or 0.04 mg/[kg d] for more than 5\% weight loss) and 9 were randomized to placebo for 9 months. After a 3-month washout period, subjects were reexamined at the 1-year time point. Six subjects elected to continue on open-label metreleptin treatment for another 12 months. Two subjects dropped out after 18 months, and 4 completed the entire 2-year study. The BMD and BMC of the total body, lumbar spine (L1-L4), hip, and radius were assessed by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of treatment. Metabolic and hormonal parameters and bone markers were measured in blood and urine. Metreleptin significantly increased BMC (P = .034) and tended to increase BMD (P = .069) at the lumbar spine at 9 months in the entire study group (intention-to-treat analysis). In subjects who completed the entire 2-year study (n = 4), metreleptin significantly increased BMD (P = .024) and BMC (P = .049) at the lumbar spine by 4\% to 6\%. Changes were not significant at the whole body, hip, and radius. Changes in hormonal and metabolic parameters and bone markers were moderate during the first year of treatment, but metreleptin further increased insulin-like growth factor 1 and decreased cortisol and cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen concentrations in serum during the second year of treatment (P {\textless} .05). The incremental area under the estradiol concentration curve over the 2-year course of the study correlated positively with the corresponding increase in lumbar spine BMD (ρ = 0.42, P = .039). Long-term metreleptin administration in strenuously exercising young women with hypothalamic amenorrhea and hypoleptinemia increases lumbar spine BMD and BMC and alters bone remodeling milieu to favor bone accretion. Results from this pilot study should be confirmed by future, larger clinical trials and need to be extended by studying bone microarchitecture and fracture risk.},

	abstract = {Throughout the sport-science and sports-medicine literature, the term “elite” subjects might be one of the most overused and ill-defined terms. Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices.},

The purpose of this project was to update the best practices for measuring RMR by indirect calorimetry in healthy and non-critically ill adults and children found the Evidence Analysis Library of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The Evidence Analysis process described by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics was followed. The Ovid database was searched for papers published between 2003 and 2012 using key words identified by the work group and research consultants, studies used in the previous project were also considered (1980 to 2003), and references were hand searched. The work group worked in pairs to assign papers to specific questions; however, the work group developed evidence summaries, conclusion statements, and recommendations as a group. Only 43 papers were included to answer 21 questions about the best practices to ensure an individual is at rest when measuring RMR in the non-critically ill population. In summary, subjects should be fasted for at least 7 hours and rest for 30 minutes in a thermoneutral, quiet, and dimly lit room in the supine position before the test, without doing any activities, including fidgeting, reading, or listening to music. RMR can be measured at any time of the day as long as resting conditions are met. The duration of the effects of nicotine and caffeine and other stimulants is unknown, but lasts longer than 140 minutes and 240 minutes, respectively. The duration of the effects of various types of exercise on RMR is unknown. Recommendations for achieving steady state, preferred gas-collection devices, and use of respiratory quotient to detect measurement errors are also given. Of the 21 conclusions statements developed in this systemic review, only 5 received a grade I or II. One limitation is the low number of studies available to address the questions and most of the included studies had small sample sizes and were conducted in healthy adults. More research on how to conduct an indirect calorimetry measurement in healthy adults and children and in sick, but not critically ill, individuals is needed.},

	abstract = {Background
The aim of the study was to examine the construct validity of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire -R18 (TFEQ-R18), a measure of eating behaviour, and to evaluate cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating and emotional eating in a sample of adolescent and young adult females of different weights.

Methods
Subjects were 2 997 females, aged 17 to 20 years, who participated in a phase III human papillomavirus vaccination trial in Finland in 2004 – 2009., Self-administered questionnaires and weight and height measurements were used. The factor structure of the TFEQ-R18 was verified by factor analysis. Connections between measured eating behaviour and Body Mass Index (BMI) were tested using analysis of variance.

Results
The original factor structure of the TFEQ-R18 was replicated: six of the eighteen items measured cognitive restraint, nine measured uncontrolled eating, and three measured emotional eating. On average, higher BMI was associated with higher levels of cognitive restraint (p {\textless} 0.001) and emotional eating (p {\textless} 0.001), but not with uncontrolled eating.

Conclusion
Structural validity of the TFEQ-R18 was good in this sample of young Finnish females with a varying range of body weights. Use of the instrument as a measure of eating behaviour was thus corroborated. Connections of restrained and emotional eating with BMI were in accordance with previous findings from young females.},

	abstract = {A revised version of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was developed in an obese population, but its applicability to the general population was not assessed. We aimed to define the relationship between eating behavior and reported food intake. This was a cross-sectional study of 529 middle-aged adults and 358 teenagers and young adults recruited on a geographical basis. The TFEQ-R18 measures 3 aspects of eating behavior: cognitive restraint (CR), uncontrolled eating (UE), and emotional eating. Reported food intake was calculated from a food frequency questionnaire. Girls who scored higher on restrained eating had a lower energy intake than the other girls (9164 kJ vs. 13,163 kJ, P {\textless} 0.001). In adult men, energy intake increased with UE (9663 kJ vs. 11,029 kJ in the lower and higher UE tertiles, respectively, P {\textless} 0.05). When specific food groups were analyzed, higher CR was positively associated in adults with healthy food groups like green vegetables [OR = 1.92 (0.68-2.44)] and negatively associated with French fries [OR = 0.35 (0.22-0.57)] and sugar [OR = 0.38 (0.23-0.61)]. Energy-dense foods, such as fat, were positively associated with UE [OR = 2.28 (1.46-3.57) for dietary fat]. Finally, emotional eaters had a higher snacking food intake. In teenagers and young adults, most associations were seen with CR. Converse to observations in adults, teenagers and young adults who exhibited a high cognitive restraint reported consumption of fewer energy-dense foods rather than more "healthy foods." The TFEQ-R18 was therefore able to distinguish among different eating patterns in our sample of a French general population.},

Methods: Longitudinal retrospective injury surveillance of the Great Britain boxing squad was performed from 2010 to 2014. The location, region affected, description, and duration of each injury were recorded by the team doctor and team physiotherapists. For each significant injury, we recorded hand grip scores using the Takei handheld dynamometer and compared the scores with baseline measures. Results: At the hand, fractures and dislocations were highly detected with an average difference of 40.2\% (P {\textless} .05) when comparing postinjury to baseline measures. At the wrist, carpometacarpal and carpal joint injuries were highly detected with an average difference of 32.6\% (P {\textless} .05). Other injuries provided varied results. In the absence of pathology, up to 15\% difference between left and right scores can be considered normal with a predominance observed below 10\%. A difference of 20\% can be indicative of a form of pathology, although pathologies can also be present with lower difference or no apparent changes. A difference of {\textgreater}20\% should be highly considered for significant pathology. Conclusions: The Takei dynamometer is a valid and reliable outcome measure tool for hand and wrist pathologies in boxing. Our study highlights the importance of appropriate clinical tools to guide injury management in this sport.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the variety of available hand-held dynamometers and their different handle shapes, reliability studies are needed.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy and reliability between three different hand-held dynamometers and analyze the influence of their handles on grip strength.
METHODS: The tests were performed with the Jamar® dynamometer, the Takei® dynamometer and the EMG System Manual Transducer with modified handle. Eighteen healthy volunteers aged 20.0±1.3 years without history of musculoskeletal disorders or trauma in the evaluated limbs were included. Data normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. To verify possible differences between the dynamometers, repeated measures ANOVA was administered, followed by Tukey post-hoc tests. Reliability between measurements was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and agreement was tested using Bland and Altman plots. The dynamometers calibration process was evaluated using linear regressions.
RESULTS: We observed statistically significant differences on the female group between the Jamar® and the Takei® dynamometers (females p{\textless}0.001 and males p=0.022) and the EMG System Manual Transducer (female p{\textless}0.001 and males p=0.007). However, the Takei® dymamometer and the EMG System Manual Transducer were similar for both female (p=0.161) and male groups (p=0.850). Although acceptable values of intraclass correlation coefficients between measurements were identified, low agreement between the Jamar® dynamometer and all other instruments was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that there is an influence of the dynamometer's handle shapes on the measurements of grip strength. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the need for previous calibration of this type of instrument.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of the present meta-analysis was to examine the scientific literature on the criterion-related validity of sit-and-reach tests for estimating hamstring and lumbar extensibility. For this purpose relevant studies were searched from seven electronic databases dated up through December 2012. Primary outcomes of criterion-related validity were Pearson´s zero-order correlation coefficients (r) between sit-and-reach tests and hamstrings and/or lumbar extensibility criterion measures. Then, from the included studies, the Hunter- Schmidt´s psychometric meta-analysis approach was conducted to estimate population criterion- related validity of sit-and-reach tests. Firstly, the corrected correlation mean (rp), unaffected by statistical artefacts (i.e., sampling error and measurement error), was calculated separately for each sit-and-reach test. Subsequently, the three potential moderator variables (sex of participants, age of participants, and level of hamstring extensibility) were examined by a partially hierarchical analysis. Of the 34 studies included in the present meta-analysis, 99 correlations values across eight sit-and-reach tests and 51 across seven sit-and-reach tests were retrieved for hamstring and lumbar extensibility, respectively. The overall results showed that all sit-and-reach tests had a moderate mean criterion-related validity for estimating hamstring extensibility (rp = 0.46-0.67), but they had a low mean for estimating lumbar extensibility (rp = 0. 16-0.35). Generally, females, adults and participants with high levels of hamstring extensibility tended to have greater mean values of criterion-related validity for estimating hamstring extensibility. When the use of angular tests is limited such as in a school setting or in large scale studies, scientists and practitioners could use the sit-and-reach tests as a useful alternative for hamstring extensibility estimation, but not for estimating lumbar extensibility. Key PointsOverall sit-and-reach tests have a moderate mean criterion-related validity for estimating hamstring extensibility, but they have a low mean validity for estimating lumbar extensibility.Among all the sit-and-reach test protocols, the Classic sit-and-reach test seems to be the best option to estimate hamstring extensibility.End scores (e.g., the Classic sit-and-reach test) are a better indicator of hamstring extensibility than the modifications that incorporate fingers-to-box distance (e.g., the Modified sit-and-reach test).When angular tests such as straight leg raise or knee extension tests cannot be used, sit-and-reach tests seem to be a useful field test alternative to estimate hamstring extensibility, but not to estimate lumbar extensibility.},

	abstract = {The potential ergogenic effects of vitamin D (vitD) in high performing athletes has received considerable attention in the literature and media. However, little is known about non-supplemented university athletes and students residing at a higher latitude. This study aimed to investigate the effects of vitD (biochemical status and dietary intake) on exercise performance in UK university athletes and sedentary students. A total of 34 athletes and 16 sedentary controls were studied during the spring and summer months. Serum vitD status and sunlight exposure were assessed using LC-MS/MS and dosimetry, respectively. Muscular strength of the upper and lower body was assessed using handgrip and knee extensor dynamometry (KE). Countermovement jump (CMJ) and aerobic fitness were measured using an Optojump and VO2max test, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using paired/ independent t-tests, ANCOVA and Pearson/ Spearman correlations, depending on normality. VitD status increased significantly over the seasons, with athletes measuring higher status both in spring (51.7±20.5 vs. 37.2±18.9 nmol/L, p = 0.03) and summer (66.7±15.8 vs 55.6±18.8 nmol/L, p = 0.04) when compared to controls, respectively. Notably, 22\% of the subjects recruited were vitD deficient during the spring term only ({\textless}25nmol/L, n 9). Subjects with 'insufficient' vitD status ({\textless}50nmol/L) elicited significantly lower CMJ when contrasted to the vitD 'sufficient' ({\textgreater}50nmol/l) group (p = 0.055) and a lower VO2 max (p = 0.05) in the spring and summer term (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively). However, an ANCOVA test showed no significant difference detected for either CMJ or VO2max following adjustments for co-variates. In conclusion, we provide novel information on the vitD status, dietary intake, physical fitness and sunlight exposure of UK young adults across two separate seasons, for which there is limited data at present.},

An accelerometric device (Myotest), a jump mat (Ergojump), an optical device (Optojump), and a smartphone app (MyJump) were simultaneously examined for concurrent validity against gold-standard measures (motion-capture system and a force platform). Twenty-two CMJ-derived variables were collected from 15 healthy male subjects (n = 60 CMJs). Contraction time (CT) and eccentric duration (EccD) measurements obtained from the Myotest were moderately to largely associated with and not different from force platform measurements (r = 0.31 to 0.64, ES = 0.11 to 0.18) and showed moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.92 to 0.97, coefficient of variation (CV) = 3.8 to 8.0\%). Flight time (FT) and jump height (JH) from Ergojump, Optojump, and MyJump showed moderate to strong associations with gold-standard measurements (r = 0.57 to 0.98) and good test⁻retest reliability (ICC = 0.54 to 0.97, CV = 1.8 to 4.2). However, all portable devices underestimated JH (ES = 1.25 to 2.75). Independent of the instrument used, the analyzed CMJ variables showed good capacity to detect changes (standard error of measurement (SEM) {\textless} smallest worthwhile change (SWC)), with the exception of rate of force and rate of power development parameters, which showed marginal capacity (SEM {\textgreater} SWC). The Myotest is preferable to measure temporal parameters during ground contact, whereas Ergojump, Optojump, and MyJump devices may be preferable to measure FT and JH, with the Optojump being the most accurate.},

	abstract = {Vertical jump is one of the most prevalent acts performed in several sport activities. It is therefore important to ensure that the measurements of vertical jump height made as a part of research or athlete support work have adequate validity and reliability. The aim of this study was to evaluate concurrent validity and reliability of the Optojump photocell system (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) with force plate measurements for estimating vertical jump height. Twenty subjects were asked to perform maximal squat jumps and countermovement jumps, and flight time-derived jump heights obtained by the force plate were compared with those provided by Optojump, to examine its concurrent (criterion-related) validity (study 1). Twenty other subjects completed the same jump series on 2 different occasions (separated by 1 week), and jump heights of session 1 were compared with session 2, to investigate test-retest reliability of the Optojump system (study 2). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for validity were very high (0.997-0.998), even if a systematic difference was consistently observed between force plate and Optojump (-1.06 cm; p {\textless} 0.001). Test-retest reliability of the Optojump system was excellent, with ICCs ranging from 0.982 to 0.989, low coefficients of variation (2.7\%), and low random errors (±2.81 cm). The Optojump photocell system demonstrated strong concurrent validity and excellent test-retest reliability for the estimation of vertical jump height. We propose the following equation that allows force plate and Optojump results to be used interchangeably: force plate jump height (cm) = 1.02 × Optojump jump height + 0.29. In conclusion, the use of Optojump photoelectric cells is legitimate for field-based assessments of vertical jump height.},

This concentration was equal to that of the vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) in the same serum sample. We removed DBP from the serum using actin affinity columns and found that the affinity for 25OHD of the remaining serum components was equivalent to that of human serum albumin (6 X 10(5) M-1). We then measured the free fractions of 25OHD, DBP, and albumin in normal and cirrhotic subjects. We calculated that 88 +/- 3\% (+/- SD) and 83 +/- 8\% of the 25OHD were bound to DBP in the serum of normal and cirrhotic subjects, respectively. We compared previously reported data for the free fraction and the free concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in these subjects with the current data for the free fraction and free concentration of 25OHD. The total concentrations and free fractions of both metabolites correlated to each other and to the DBP and albumin concentrations in these subjects, but the free concentrations of these metabolites did not. We conclude that 25OHD, like 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, is transported in blood bound primarily to DBP and albumin. Changes in the concentrations of DBP and albumin affected the total and free fractions of 25OHD in serum, but the actual free concentration of 25OHD was independent of such changes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The Actiheart (Mini Mitter, Sunriver, OR, USA) uses heart rate (HR) and activity data to predict activity energy expenditure (AEE). Currently, the Actiheart has only been tested during laboratory conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to validate the Actiheart prediction method against indirect calorimetry during a wide range of activities in a field setting.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Forty-eight participants (age: 35+/-11.4 years) were recruited for the study. Eighteen activities were split into three routines of six activities and each routine was performed by 20 participants. During each routine, the participants wore an Actiheart and simultaneously, AEE was measured with a Cosmed K4b(2) portable metabolic system. The manufacturer's HR algorithm, activity algorithm, and combined activity and HR algorithm were used to estimate AEE.
RESULTS: The mean error (and 95\% prediction intervals) for the combined activity and HR algorithm, HR algorithm, and activity algorithm versus the Cosmed K4b(2) were 0.02 kJ kg(-1) min(-1) (-0.17, 0.22 kJ kg(-1) min(-1)), -0.03 kJ kg(-1) min(-1) (-0.24, 0.18 kJ kg(-1) min(-1)), and 0.14 kJ kg(-1) min(-1) (-0.12, 0.40 kJ kg(-1) min(-1)), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The Actiheart combined activity and HR algorithm and HR algorithm provide similar estimates of AEE on both a group and individual basis.},

Greater precision and accuracy in the measurement of this key contributor to energy balance is a research priority. We developed a laboratory-based protocol that simulated a range of low-to-moderate intensity physical activities. We characterized the bias and random (individual) error in estimating energy expenditure using combined accelerometry and heart rate (AHR) with branched-equation modeling and a simple motion sensor (pedometer) against an indirect calorimetry criterion. Twenty young adult subjects performed a 2-h laboratory-based protocol, simulating 6 low-to-moderate intensity physical activities interspersed with periods of rest. The physical activity level during the laboratory-based protocol reflected an energy expenditure toward the lower end of the active category. We found that AHR-derived energy expenditure showed no evidence of substantial fixed or proportional bias (mean bias 6\%), whereas pedometer-derived energy expenditure showed both fixed and proportional bias (bias at minimum, mean, and maximum energy expenditure +11, -20, and -36\%, respectively). It appears that AHR provides an accurate estimate of criterion energy expenditure whereas a simple motion sensor (pedometer) does not. It is noteworthy that AHR provides quantitative information about the nature and patterns of physical activity, such as the amount of time and/or energy spent engaged in physical activity above critical health-related thresholds.},

	abstract = {We assessed sunlight and dietary contributions to vitamin D status in British postmenopausal women. Our true longitudinal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements varied seasonally, being lower in the north compared to the south and lower in Asian women. Sunlight exposure in summer and spring provided 80\% total annual intake of vitamin D.
INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D deficiency is highlighted as a potential problem for countries at high latitude, but there are few true longitudinal, seasonal data to allow regional comparisons. We aimed to directly compare seasonal variation in vitamin D status (25(OH)D) in postmenopausal women at two northerly latitudes and to assess the relative contributions of sunlight exposure and diet.
METHODS: Vitamin D status was assessed in 518 postmenopausal women (age 55-70 years) in a two-centre cohort study with serum collected at fixed three-monthly intervals from summer 2006 for immunoassay measurement of 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone. At 57° N (Aberdeen, Scotland, UK), there were 338 Caucasian women; at 51° N (Surrey, South of England, UK), there were 144 Caucasian women and 35 Asian women. UVB exposure (polysulphone film badges) and dietary vitamin D intakes (food diaries) were also estimated.
RESULTS: Caucasian women had lower 25(OH)D (p {\textless} 0.001) at 57° N compared to 51° N. Median (interquartile range) in nanomoles per litre for summer (June-August) at 57° N was 43.0 (20.9) and at 51° N was 62.5 (26.6) and for winter (December-February) at 57° N was 28.3 (18.9) and at 51° N was 39.9 (24.0). For Asian women at 51° N, median 25(OH)D was 24.0 (15.8) nmol/L in summer and 16.9 (15.9) nmol/L in winter. Median dietary vitamin D intakes were 80-100 IU for Caucasians and 50-65 IU for the Asian women. Sunlight was the main contributor to 25(OH)D with spring and summer providing {\textgreater}80\% total annual intake.
CONCLUSIONS: These longitudinal data show significant regional and ethnic differences in UVB exposure and vitamin D status for postmenopausal women at northerly latitudes. The numbers of women who are vitamin D deficient is a major concern and public health problem.},

	abstract = {Background Current methods for injury registration in sports injury epidemiology studies may substantially underestimate the true burden of overuse injuries due to a reliance on time-loss injury definitions.
Objective To develop and validate a new method for the registration of overuse injuries in sports.
Methods A new method, including a new overuse injury questionnaire, was developed and validated in a 13-week prospective study of injuries among 313 athletes from five different sports, cross-country skiing, floorball, handball, road cycling and volleyball. All athletes completed a questionnaire by email each week to register problems in the knee, lower back and shoulder. Standard injury registration methods were also used to record all time-loss injuries that occurred during the study period.
Results The new method recorded 419 overuse problems in the knee, lower back and shoulder during the 3-month-study period. Of these, 142 were classified as substantial overuse problems, defined as those leading to moderate or severe reductions in sports performance or participation, or time loss. Each week, an average of 39\% of athletes reported having overuse problems and 13\% reported having substantial problems. In contrast, standard methods of injury registration registered only 40 overuse injuries located in the same anatomical areas, the majority of which were of minimal or mild severity.
Conclusion Standard injury surveillance methods only capture a small percentage of the overuse problems affecting the athletes, largely because few problems led to time loss from training or competition. The new method captured a more complete and nuanced picture of the burden of overuse injuries in this cohort.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been an exponential rise in the professionalism and success of female sports. Practitioners (e.g., sport science professionals) aim to apply evidence-informed approaches to optimise athlete performance and well-being. Evidence-informed practices should be derived from research literature. Given the lack of research on elite female athletes, this is challenging at present. This limits the ability to adopt an evidence-informed approach when working in female sports, and as such, we are likely failing to maximize the performance potential of female athletes. This article discusses the challenges of applying an evidence base derived from male athletes to female athletes. A conceptual framework is presented, which depicts the need to question the current (male) evidence base due to the differences of the “female athlete” and the “female sporting environment,” which pose a number of challenges for practitioners working in the field. Until a comparable applied sport science research evidence base is established in female athletes, evidence-informed approaches will remain a challenge for those working in female sport.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Resting energy expenditure (REE) may fluctuate during the menstrual cycle (MC), due to the physiological effects of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). This study examined changes in REE and metabolic hormones (leptin, ghrelin, thyroid hormones), and dietary intake in two hormonally distinct groups, naturally menstruating women (NoOC) and women using monophasic combined oral contraceptives (COC).
METHODS: Measurements included REE by indirect calorimetry, body composition by bioimpedance, and blood samples for hormone analysis in the early follicular and mid-luteal phases of the MC in NoOC-group (n = 38) or the active and inactive phases of the COC cycle (COC, n = 19). Participants recorded their food intake for 3 days after measurements. A secondary analysis was completed for the NoOC-group without REE outliers (difference between measurements {\textgreater}1.5 × interquartile range, n = 4).
RESULTS: In the NoOC-group, luteal phase REE was 40 kcal higher than follicular phase REE [95\% confidence interval (CI): -2 kcal/d-82 kcal/d, d = 0.20, p = 0.061]. Leptin (d = 0.35, p {\textless} 0.001), T3 (d = 0.26, p = 0.05) and fat intake (d = 0.48, p = 0.027) were lower, and T4 (d = 0.21, p = 0.041) was higher in the luteal phase. After excluding outliers, REE was 44 kcal higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (95\% CI: 12 kcal/d-76 kcal/d, d = 0.22, p = 0.007). In the COC-group, the mean difference in REE was -2 kcal (95\% CI-82 kcal/d-79 kcal/d) between active and inactive phases, while T3 was higher in the inactive phase (d = 0.01, p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: REE increases only slightly from the follicular to the luteal phase but remains unchanged between COC phases. Increases in T3, leptin, and fat intake during the luteal phase might echo metabolic fluctuations that parallel female sex hormones during the MC.},

The aim of this study was to assess low energy availability and its possible consequences among female triathletes by using the Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q).
METHODS: The study involved 30 female triathetes. The LEAF-Q was used in the study. An analysis of the body composition was carried out with the seca device mBCA 515 medical Body Composition Analyzer.
RESULTS: Of the 30 female triathletes studied, 23.3\% had a monthly cycle disorder, defined as an amenorrhea state for more than 90 days. No differences were found in injury rates or training days lost to injury due to menstrual disturbances. Menstruation changes were significantly greater due to increases in exercise intensity, frequency, and duration in the group experiencing menstrual disturbances (85.7 [95\% CIs: 42.1-99.6] vs. 8.7 [95\% CIs: 1.1-28.0]). The menstrual disorder group had a greater incidence of their periods stopping for more than 3 months than the group without menstrual disturbances.
CONCLUSIONS: The female triathletes did not show abnormalities in body weight or composition, and these were not related to the incidence of menstrual disturbances. However, 20\% of the triathletes either had, at the time of the study, or had had in the past monthly cycle disorders that could indicate an immediate risk of low energy availability. The LEAF-Q identified 10\% of the triathletes as at risk (score {\textgreater} 8) of low energy availability and the physiological and performance consequences related to relative energy deficiency in sports (RED-S).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low energy availability (EA) in female athletes with or without an eating disorder (ED) increases the risk of oligomenorrhoea/functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea and impaired bone health, a syndrome called the female athlete triad (Triad). There are validated psychometric instruments developed to detect disordered eating behaviour (DE), but no validated screening tool to detect persistent low EA and Triad conditions, with or without DE/ED, is available.
AIM: The aim of this observational study was to develop and test a screening tool designed to identify female athletes at risk for the Triad.
METHODS: Female athletes (n=84) with 18-39 years of age and training ≥5 times/week filled out the Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q), which comprised questions regarding injuries and gastrointestinal and reproductive function. Reliability and internal consistency were evaluated in a subsample of female dancers and endurance athletes (n=37). Discriminant as well as concurrent validity was evaluated by testing self-reported data against measured current EA, menstrual function and bone health in endurance athletes from sports such as long distance running and triathlon (n=45).
RESULTS: The 25-item LEAF-Q produced an acceptable sensitivity (78\%) and specificity (90\%) in order to correctly classify current EA and/or reproductive function and/or bone health.
CONCLUSIONS: The LEAF-Q is brief and easy to administer, and relevant as a complement to existing validated DE screening instruments, when screening female athletes at risk for the Triad, in order to enable early detection and intervention.},

This study explored the ability of the LEAF-Q to detect conditions related to low energy availability (LEA) in a mixed sport cohort of female athletes. Data included the LEAF-Q, SCOFF Questionnaire for disordered eating, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition and bone mineral density, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, blood pressure, and blood metabolic and reproductive hormones. Participants were grouped according to LEAF-Q score (≥8 or {\textless}8), and a comparison of means was undertaken. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the overall score and subscale scores were calculated in relation to the triad and biomarkers relevant to LEA. Fisher's exact test explored differences in prevalence of these conditions between groups. Seventy-five athletes (18-32 years) participated. Mean LEAF-Q score was 8.0 ± 4.2 (55\% scored ≥8). Injury and menstrual function subscale scores identified low bone mineral density (100\% sensitivity, 95\% confidence interval [15.8\%, 100\%]) and menstrual dysfunction (80.0\% sensitivity, 95\% confidence interval [28.4\%, 99.5\%]), respectively. The gastrointestinal subscale did not detect surrogate markers of LEA. LEAF-Q score cannot be used to classify athletes as "high risk" of conditions related to LEA, nor can it be used as a surrogate diagnostic tool for LEA given the low specificity identified. Our study supports its use as a screening tool to rule out risk of LEA-related conditions or to create selective low-risk groups that do not need management as there were generally high negative predictive values (range 76.5-100\%) for conditions related to LEA.},

	abstract = {Low energy availability (EA) underpins the female and male athlete triad and relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). The condition arises when insufficient calories are consumed to support exercise energy expenditure, resulting in compromised physiological processes, such as menstrual irregularities in active females. The health concerns associated with longstanding low EA include menstrual/libido, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular dysfunction and compromised bone health, all of which can contribute to impaired sporting performance. This narrative review provides an update of our previous review on the prevalence and risk of low EA, within-day energy deficiency, and the potential impact of low EA on performance. The methods to assess EA remain a challenge and contribute to the methodological difficulties in identifying "true" low EA. Screening female athletic groups using a validated screening tool such as the Low Energy Availability in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q) has shown promise in identifying endurance athletes at risk of low EA. Knowledge of RED-S and its potential implications for performance is low among coaches and athletes alike. Development of sport and gender-specific screening tools to identify adolescent and senior athletes in different sports at risk of RED-S is warranted. Education initiatives are required to raise awareness among coaches and athletes of the importance of appropriate dietary strategies to ensure that sufficient calories are consumed to support training.},

Athletes were distinguished according to benchmarks of reproductive function (amenorrheic [n = 13] vs. eumenorrheic [n = 22], low [lowest quartile of reference range; n = 10] versus normal testosterone [n = 14]), and EA calculated from 7-day food and training diaries ({\textless} or {\textgreater}30 kcal·kg-1 fat-free mass·day-1). Sex hormones (p {\textless} .001), triiodothyronine (p {\textless} .05), and bone mineral density (females, p {\textless} .05) were significantly lower in amenorrheic (37\%) and low testosterone (40\%; 15.1 ± 3.0 nmol/L) athletes, and bone injuries were ∼4.5-fold more prevalent in amenorrheic (effect size = 0.85, large) and low testosterone (effect size = 0.52, moderate) groups compared with others. Categorization of females and males using Triad or RED-S tools revealed that higher risk groups had significantly lower triiodothyronine (female and male Triad and RED-S: p {\textless} .05) and higher number of all-time fractures (male Triad: p {\textless} .001; male RED-S and female Triad: p {\textless} .01) as well as nonsignificant but markedly (up to 10-fold) higher number of training days lost to bone injuries during the preceding year. Based on the cross-sectional analysis, current reproductive function (questionnaires/blood hormone concentrations) appears to provide a more objective and accurate marker of optimal energy for health than the more error-prone and time-consuming dietary and training estimation of EA. This study also offers novel findings that athlete health is associated with EA indices.},

The primary aim of the present review was to systematically investigate the impact of chronic strenuous exercise on the energy status of professional female athletes compared to sedentary, recreationally active controls as concerns their menstrual status and bone mineral density (BMD). A secondary aim was evaluation of the combined prevalence of the components of the female athlete triad in athletes as compared to non-athletes.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted from 2007 to February 2018. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the studies were established in advance of the literature search according to the clinical inquiry and the study design.
RESULTS: Four studies were included in this systematic review. The female athlete triad was more prevalent in professional athletes compared to non-athletes. The same results were obtained for both LEA and menstrual disorders. However, BMD and Z-scores showed high heterogeneity among the studies.
CONCLUSION: Both female athletes and non-athletes are prone to LEA and subsequent menstrual disorders and low BMD or osteoporosis. Future studies are needed to examine energy availability in elite female athletes as well as in non-athletes.},
